## 1. UX

##### Project Goals

The goal of this project was to create a restaurant booking website to demonstrate the skills and knowledge I have learned and used over the third module in the diploma I am studying. This is to show that I have the skills, knowledge and experience of a Junior Software Developer in working with HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Python, Django and other technologies, with the hope of one day gaining employment within this growing and impactful industry.

##### Developer and Business Goals

The business/developer goal of this restaurant booking website is to increase sales for their restaurant business. By creating a website for the restaurant, this would advertise the restaurant on the internet to help gain traction to increase sales. Furthermore, displaying appetising images of the meals that are served with apt descriptions will help to gain traction within the community, persuading people to dine in this establishment to create a successful business by allowing people to order meals online.

##### User Goals
The user goal for this site is to have a clear purpose for the site, see what meals they have available with appropriate descriptions with pictures via a menu section. Users will also want to book for a certain time, date, and amount of people to enjoy a great dining experience at this establishment. Easy navigation, along with good UX principles are also required to provide a great user experience for the site’s users.


##### User Stories
Here is a link to all the information about the user stories used in this project, I recommend checking it out to see the full picture of which features were added and why. It is available to the public, meaning anyone with access to this link should in turn be able to access these user stories:

However, here is a summary of them below (in no particular order): 

1. Page Layout

As someone who is unfamiliar with technology, computers, and the internet, I want the page format to be in a standard page layout that will allow me to easily be able to navigate this website.

2. Extensive Menu

As a food enthusiast, I want to be able to see the restaurant full menu, including a starter, main course, and dessert section so I can see a varied choice of meals and know what I want to order.

3. Pictures and Description 

As a user of this establishment, I want to be able to see the pictures and descriptions of all menu items to help understand how the restaurant prepares its dishes, to see if it suits my taste.

4. Number of People to Book 

As a social diner, I want to be able to book a different amount of people per order so I can order alone and with my friends.

5. Booking Confirmation

As a user who lives far away, I want to be able to make a booking for the restaurant,  and see the confirmation of my booking order on the site after I’ve made the booking for reassurance of my booking.

6. Restaurant Reviews

As a Food Critic, I want to be able to sign up/create an account for this website to be able to share my thoughts with others about my dining experience for my job, while also being able to see others’ reviews.

7. Home page 

As a user who’s unaware of this establishment, I want to see the purpose of this website on the home/welcoming page to understand the point of this website and how it applies to me, the user.

8. Contact Details

As a user wishing to question the owner beforehand, I want a contact section with the establishments contact details so I can contact the owner easily.

9. Dietary requirements

As a user who is vegan with medical conditions, I want to see meals that Gluten free and vegan so I know what I can order.


##### Wireframes

Wireframes were used in the preparation of this project to help create the layout of the website that acted as a guide once I had commenced coding. These wireframes were created in the inception phase of this project, as I was planning out ideas. They are seen here:

## 2. Features

##### Existing Features

At the conclusion of this project, this website is fully functioning and has all of the necessary features that a fully functioning restaurant booking system website would need, and the features that were set out in the user stories section (exvept the could have review section).

This website is fully responsive, and designed to look good regardless of what screen size is being used. A 'mobile-first' approach was used when designing this website as this is the most popular device size that is currently used when surfing the internet and browsing websites, and screen size was upscaled from there and designed in a way that would make it look good on larger screens with the use of bootstrap’s column function. The site looks good on any device, with content shifting to appropriate locations on the screen as the screen size changes, providing a great user experience.

This website is easy to navigate, as it is constructed in a way that users would expect. There is a navbar at the top with working links to each of the pages users may wish to visit, reinforcing a sense of familiarity and adding an expected page structure that users expect, making it familiar and easy to navigate. The main content in the page is arranged in a way that makes sense and allows easy manoeuvring. Buttons have also been placed on all pages, prompting users to move throughout the website and complete their reservation to dine in this establishment. Pictures and descriptions are provided for menu items, encouraging users to dine in this establishment as the see the food and how it’s prepared.

The title of the restaurant is in the navbar that displays the business' name, sat in a warm, cozy and comfortable brown emphasising the welcoming nature of the page, and it is located at the top of the page regardless of screen size for all users to see. Furthermore, there is a welcome message on the home page to greet the user as they enter the site, explaining the purpose of the site and how it can be used to benefit them and meet any potential user needs.

This restaurant website is user friendly, allowing users read the home page to get a sense of the website’s purpose, naturally taking them to the menu to gain an interest in dining at the restaurant as they see the appetising meals with quality pictures and vivid descriptions. This carries them along to the reservation page where users fill in their personal details and details of their booking requests, which will be confirmed by the booking success page, providing them with their booking details. A button then invites them to return home where they can navigate to the review page of the website, allowing users to provide a review of their experience at the diner (Review section coming soon!). 

There is a footer on the page that contains the site owner's contact information. It contains an email address, allowing anyone to easily contact the site owner for any requests, and it also contains social media links linking users to the site's social media pages to follow for any future updates to the site.
