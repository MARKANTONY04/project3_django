## 1. UX

##### Project Goals

The goal of this project was to create a restaurant booking website to demonstrate the skills and knowledge I have learned and used over the third module in the diploma I am studying. This is to show that I have the skills, knowledge and experience of a Junior Software Developer in working with HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Python, Django and other technologies, with the hope of one day gaining employment within this growing and impactful industry.

##### Developer and Business Goals

The business/developer goal of this restaurant booking website is to increase sales for their restaurant business. By creating a website for the restaurant, this would advertise the restaurant on the internet to help gain traction to increase sales. Furthermore, displaying appetising images of the meals that are served with apt descriptions will help to gain traction within the community, persuading people to dine in this establishment to create a successful business by allowing people to order meals online.

##### User Goals
The user goal for this site is to have a clear purpose for the site, see what meals they have available with appropriate descriptions with pictures via a menu section. Users will also want to book for a certain time, date, and amount of people to enjoy a great dining experience at this establishment. Easy navigation, along with good UX principles are also required to provide a great user experience for the siteâ€™s users.
